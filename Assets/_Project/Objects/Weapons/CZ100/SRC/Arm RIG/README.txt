Rig done entirely by me: Jericho - https://www.youtube.com/@TeamJericho

Meshes and assets belong to Activision/Infinity Ward

If you upload a video animation with this rig to any platform, you MUST credit me and specify my YT link.

Rig is intended for animators to have fun and practice with, not intended to be used for any commercial gain or game projects.

Includes 3DSmax file, but also an fbx file without any IK/Controllers. Sorry Blender :(


Enjoy!
